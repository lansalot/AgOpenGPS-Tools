# Tracker

So, for those of us that are worried about theft, I thought I might make a little program I can install on my tablet, so if it will update a public service (eg, perhaps a web service somewhere, send an email on regular interval with location, who knows) so if the kit disappears, it'll sing the moment it's turned on again.

This is just the very basic "How to pull the location from AOG" with a console app - at the moment, it doesn't hide itself or anything like that.

The idea, if I persist with this, is it'll run as a service, disguised, and start when the machine does. As soon as it sees a location stream, it'll... do something.

What that something is just yet, not decided. Maybe update a web service with a cosmos backend so I can store say a couple hours worth of "where's my tractor at"?

Sample web page enclosed that just moves a point on a map every 5 seconds. Totally disconnected from the tracker of course...
