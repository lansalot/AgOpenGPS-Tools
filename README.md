Some tools for AgOpenGPS


- AgDiag - an updated version of the AgDiag tool, please log any issues with missing PGNs
- Network Analysis - a LUA file to decode AOG traffic in wireshark
- STLs - various AOG-related 3d print stuff I've found
- Tracker - an app you can run on your tablet, hidden, that will report the location (under development, an idea to help locate stolen equipment)

Apart from this, there's a handy tool for flashing Teensy here: https://github.com/lansalot/AOGTeensyFlasher
