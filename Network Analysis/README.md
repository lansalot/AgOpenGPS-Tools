# Wireshark dissector for AgOpenGPS traffic

Put this in your %APPDATA%\wireshark\plugins folder, or \Program Files\wireshark\plugins folder (not any subfolders, eg 4.0) and it will decode wireshark traffic. Please log any issues you find and where possible, please include a packet capture.

If you're using linux, place it in ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins
